> [!NOTE] Reflexivity
> This means if **AB is subset of ABC** that means **ABC -> AB** is valid functional dependency. It is also **trivial functional dependency** cause we getting **AB from ABC** which **AB is subset of ABC**.

> [!NOTE] Augmentation
> If we have functional dependency **A -> B**, we can add C to both sides and have **AC -> BC** which will still be valid.

> [!NOTE] Transitivity
> As understood from name if **A -> B and B -> C** are valid, **A -> C** is valid also.
